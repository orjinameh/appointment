        <p>
        EV Pro World is humbly proud to be a one stop shop for all your e-bike, scooter, moped and motorcycle 
        needs as we offer full repair services to our customers. (We also service ATVs, 4 wheelers, golf carts,
         unicycles, and any other powersport vehicles that are electric.) Please note that when coming in for a
          service repair, you are required to pay a non-refundable diagnostic fee of $80.00 up front or prior to 
          drop off. San Diego tax of 7.75% is not included but equates to $86.20. This fee also goes towards the 
          total cost of service. If it exceeds that cost, we will notify you of anything additional so you will 
          have the opportunity to decide if you want to proceed or decline the service (s) recommended. Labor cost 
          is $100.00 per hour. Based upon the findings from the diagnostic test, if you, the customer, decline the 
          repair (s) after being informed of the service (s) needed, you will have 15 days to pick up your item. If
           your item is still in our repair center after 15 days, you, the customer, will be charged a storage fee of
            $20.00 per day. Once it exceeds 30 days and we receive no communications from you, the customer, your item
             will be recycled and EV Pro World LLC will no longer be responsible or liable for it. You, the customer, 
             orfeited your rights to retrieve your item after the 30 day period. EV Pro World will not be liable or 
             responsible for your item after 30 days if you made the choice not to pick it up after declining the 
             service repair. The same terms above apply to repairs that were agreed upon and successfully completed</p>

The customer is 100% responsible for the return shipping of the item ensuring that it is returned in its original, undamaged packaging. If the original product packaging is damaged, we will assess a fee up to $50. Therefore, it is recommended that the customer take photos of the box and / or shipping envelope prior to shipping.

It is encouraged, but at the discretion of the customer, to insure the package as EV Pro World will not be responsible for any lost or stolen merchandise / products that do not arrive back to us.

If you, the customer, removed the tags, abused the use of the products, or destroyed the original packaging, we might be unable to accept the return, as EV Pro World reserves the right to refuse your return or exchange request, and the right to charge a restocking fee and other handling costs based on our sole and exclusive discretion. EV Pro World will charge additional fees for any accepted product returns which are found to be damaged upon receipt and inspection by EV Pro World.

However, the product / merchandise is eligible for return with normal ride wear and tear, which includes, a small amount of tread wear equal to no more than 50 miles of normal use, under typical usage patterns, as well as a minimal amount of wear on the breaks, and deck and no outlandish scratches.

Refunds are processed upon the receipt and inspection of the product / merchandise. You, the customer, will receive an email confirming that your refund has been processed, and the funds will appear in the original account used to make the purchase within ten (10) business days of the refund being issued, depending on your bank.
